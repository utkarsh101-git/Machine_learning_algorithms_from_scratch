# Machine_learning_algorithms_from_scratch

## Advance Support Vector Classifier used for classification task

### This machine learning algorithm uses Adam Optimizer for faster convergence than regular SGDClassifier

### Supports kernels (Radial Basis Function kernel) to identify complex patterns in the training data

## Model testing(SVC)
### This Machine algorithm outperformed the SGDClassifier(loss='hinge')  on Scikt learn's Breast Cancer dataset and make_moons dataset achieved accuracy of 95%

## Logistic Regression
### This machine learning algorithm is used for classification task (Linear Classifier)
### This algorithm gradient descent as optimizer for training and uses learning rate scheduling for smoother convergence (prevents jumping around the optimal value)

## K-nearest Neighbour 
### This machine learning algorithm is used for classification task and uses different types of distances(Elucidean, Manhattan) to distinguish between classes
