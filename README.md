# Machine_learning_algorithms_from_scratch

## Advance Support Vector Classifier used for classification task

## This machine learning algorithm uses Adam Optimizer for faster convergence than regular SGDClassifier

## Supports kernels (Radial Basis Function kernel) to identify complex patterns in the training data

# Model testing
## This Machine algorithm outperformed the SGDClassifier(loss='hinge')  on Scikt learn's Breast Cancer dataset and make_moons dataset
